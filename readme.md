Easy finance - training project

In this project i am trying to use all i can by using the native javascript abilites. Adaptive and responsive markup as well. Not a good UI/UX, but i am not the designer, sorry.

Sticky navigation menu.
Multilanguage.
Planing to create and use video background in hero block.
Accordion common questions block.
Tabs create on js. Yeah, i know, i could use the html native tools to create this block, but wanted to create it on a single page application conception, so i implemented the real-time rendering content. When you choose the tab, content will render from json. This is stupid, but who cares?
Your chosen tab linked with the form below, f.ex: if you will choose "mortgage" it will translate to the needed in a calculation form. The currency select influence to the "Loan sum" - range input, and also depends on your region. The contact form sending implemented on a PHPMailer plugin. The "Feedback block" will be implement on a swiper js to make code shorter, and show that i can use the modern, and the most usefull, optimizated and fullfilment js libs and tools. For now, users region defenition implement on a ip-api.com, but it is not the best desision, because to use the https i should pay about 13$ per month, not very smart for the averege training project. Now i am looking for the fully free api, or will use native geolocation api, to recieve the gps coordinats and compare them to the selfmade objects containes the typical coordinats of different regions. All scroll animation will be implement by native js tools without libs. I know, that all of this i was able to make by the already createted libs and tools, but i decided to make all of this by my hands to show to myself, that i fully understand how it work inside the box.
